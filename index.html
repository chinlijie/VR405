        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          Effective interprofessional communication among healthcare professionals is essential for patient health and recovery in hospital settings. Nurses, in particular, play a vital role in identifying and managing patient deterioration, as they are often the first to observe changes in patients' vital signs. Early intervention by the nursing team significantly enhances patient outcomes by reducing the risk of morbidity, shortening hospital stays, and improving the overall quality of care [1].
        </p>
        <b&lt;br&gt;>
        <p>
          Despite the presence of early warning systems, such as routine monitoring and assessment of physiological parameters by nurses, accurately predicting patient deterioration remains challenging, as it can occur unexpectedly [2]. Therefore, nurses must be thoroughly trained and prepared to respond to patient deterioration by confidently assessing the patient, initiating a code blue response, and communicating effectively with other team members to manage the situation.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Problem of Interest </h2>
        <p>
          Nursing students often lack sufficient exposure and learning opportunities to develop effective communication skills for managing patient deterioration before graduation. Their clinical experience is typically limited to rotations, which do not guarantee encounters with live deterioration cases [2]. Additionally, there is a lack of effective, integrated training between different healthcare groups, such as doctors and nurses, which is essential to prevent adverse patient outcomes. Effective communication during resuscitation in patient deterioration is key to ensuring patient safety [3]. Studies indicate that pre-registration nursing students often graduate with adequate theoretical knowledge but are not fully prepared to handle rapid patient deterioration in practice. This gap may stem from challenges in integrating theoretical knowledge with practical competency during classroom simulations, where lack of active engagement reduces learning effectiveness [4].
        </p>
        <b&lt;br&gt;>
        <p>
          The current curriculum for nursing students relies on mannequin simulations for resuscitation (code blue) cases, with nursing professors acting as facilitators and sometimes filling roles such as that of a doctor to teach different nursing responsibilities. However, this approach has significant limitations, including high resource demands. Simulations require trained facilitators, costly equipment, and dedicated facilities, which restrict learning to small groups and limit opportunities for repetitive practice. These constraints affect long-term retention, a crucial element in mastering resuscitation skills [5].
        </p>

          subtitle="High Fidelity Mannequin Simulation"></image-component>
        <b&lt;br&gt;>
        <p>
          In addition to mannequin-based training, a desktop virtual application known as CREATIVE (Create Real-time Experience and Teamwork In Virtual Environment) has been employed. In this program, nursing students use avatars controlled by keyboard and mouse to learn about different roles and actions in resuscitation scenarios. However, these simulations lack the realism and immersion essential for developing transferable psychomotor skills. Additionally, the desktop format induces less stress than real-life scenarios, which is a vital component of simulation training intended to mimic real patient cases.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/creative.png"
        subtitle="CREATIVE Desktop Simulation"></image-component>
        <b&lt;br&gt;>
        <p>
          Current literature suggests that Virtual Reality (VR) could significantly enhance medical training. VR is recognized as a powerful educational tool that can improve and standardize learning objectives through an immersive curriculum [6]. Studies on the use of VR for recognizing and responding to rapidly deteriorating patients among undergraduate nursing students have demonstrated improved confidence and critical thinking. This benefit is due to reduced stress and the opportunity for repeated practice of complex scenarios, which VR can facilitate effectively [2]. VR has also been shown to provide a high degree of interactivity with Head-Mounted Displays, increase participant satisfaction through clear instructions and feedback, and reduce the average time needed per case [7].
        </p>
        <b&lt;br&gt;>
        <p>
          However, despite the potential of VR, there remains a lack of immersive VR simulation training focused specifically on patient deterioration for healthcare professionals. A previous student project attempted to build a virtual hospital environment for a code blue scenario using the Unity Engine, but it was limited by the absence of a multiplayer interface and a voice transcription function.

      <h2> 3. Proposed Solution </h2>
      <p>
        The Resuscitation Virtual Reality Scenario with Code Blue Training is designed to simulate a hospital "Code Blue" emergency, providing an immersive multiplayer training environment for nursing students. This VR scenario replicates the high-pressure setting of patient deterioration to facilitate the development of interprofessional communication, team coordination, and rapid decision-making skills.      
      </p>
      <b&lt;br&gt;>
      <p>
        Key features of this VR training solution includes multiplayer interaction where nursing students are able to practice various roles within the resuscitation team, enabling them to understand each role's responsibilities and to experience teamwork in a realistic, interactive environment. Additionally, a voice transcription function where communication within the scenario is recorded and transcribed, allowing students and facilitators to review conversations afterward. This feature is designed to help identify areas for improvement in communication and collaboration skills.

      <h2> 4. Value Proposition </h2>
      <p>
        The proposed VR training solution enables nursing students to achieve the learning outcome of effectively managing high-stress patient deterioration scenarios. Through immersive practice, students improve their interprofessional communication and coordination skills, which are critical for handling real-life emergencies. Additionally, this VR platform offers facilitators the flexibility to conduct simulations more frequently, fostering proactive student participation and enhancing learning engagement.

      <div id="sub-section-6-header-1">
        <h3>6.1 Multiplayer Network Room Logic </h3>
        <p>
          The multiplayer networking functionality is tested using the Photon Pun 2 SDK, which enables the creation and management of multiplayer rooms. The NetworkManager script is responsible for creating the rooms over the network, allowing users to join and participate in multiplayer sessions. To ensure that each participant can be represented within the virtual environment, the NetworkPlayer script spawns avatars for each user, allowing them to have a visual presence in the room. Additionally, the NetworkPlayerSpawner script facilitates the process of adding players to the networked room, ensuring that each user is seamlessly integrated into the multiplayer scenario.

        <h3>6.2 Game Object Networking </h3>
        <p>
          In order for each player to interact with objects and see the actions of other players in the networked environment, object networking is implemented. The XR Grab Network Interactable component enables players to grab and manipulate objects within the simulation, with their actions synchronized across all participants. To ensure that objects move consistently and smoothly for all users, the Photon Rigidbody View component is used, which synchronizes the object’s motion over the network. Additionally, the Photon View component manages the ownership of these objects, allowing objects to be transferred between players, ensuring that the correct player controls the relevant object during the simulation.

        <h3>6.3 Network Voice </h3>
        <p>
          To enable voice communication between players in the VR simulation, the Network Voice Client is implemented. This allows participants to communicate in real-time during the scenario. The functionality for voice transcription is planned for future integration, enabling the capture and review of communication for training purposes.

      <h2> 7. Future Work </h2>
      <p>
        The next steps for this project will involve several critical activities aimed at finalizing and improving the training experience. First, we will collaborate with the nursing school to finalize the resuscitation scenarios through storyboarding, ensuring that all key steps and roles are accurately represented for the training simulation. Following this, the Code Blue VR Project will be created using the existing pediatric project template, with necessary adaptations made to suit the specific requirements of resuscitation training scenarios.
      </p>
      <b&lt;br&gt;>
      <p>
        Additionally, user testing will be conducted to gather valuable feedback from participants, which will help identify areas for improvement and guide any necessary iterations of the project. Finally, a detailed project timeline outlining the sequence of steps required for completion is provided in Appendix A for reference, which will help track the project's progress and ensure all milestones are met on schedule.
